# Writing an issue
## In general:
when submitting a path, you can remove redundant/sensitive information and replace it with /*/. 

## Enhancement
If you have a feature suggestion, you can submit it, but keep in mind that until v1.0.0, I probably wont get around to them.

## Bug Report
You should submit as much information/code as nessecary, and can also submit pseudocode if any regular code examples are to abstract.

## Crash Report
Copy/Paste the entire Traceback into the issue, and outline what was happening in the called lines in your code.
